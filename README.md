# Image Deepfake Detection
## Overview
This project aims to implement and improve deepfake detection methods with a high level of generalization. It addresses images generated using General Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and other emerging generative techniques by identifying perceptual cues left by these methods. The approaches involve using pretrained models for feature extraction and traditional classifiers for detecting fake images.
